The code provided recommends cities to a user based on their
budget, number of cities to be visited, and user location. Let&#39;s
break down the code and understand its functionality:  


1. Loading the Dataset:
The code loads the users, flights, and hotels datasets
using the pandas library. The actual file paths need to
be provided in the read_csv() function calls.


2. Preparing Dataframes:
 The code creates new dataframes final_users,
final_hotels, and final_flights by selecting specific
columns from the original datasets.


3. Filtering and Sorting:
 The function recommended_cities() takes the user&#39;s
code, budget, number of cities, and user location as
input.
 It first filters the flights dataset (filtered_flightscsv) to
consider only flights from the user&#39;s location.
 The filtered flights dataset is then sorted by price in
ascending order (sorted_flights).


4. Selecting Cities:
 The code initializes an empty list selected_cities to
store the selected cities.
 It iterates over the sorted flights dataset and checks if
the destination city is not already selected. If not, it
adds the city to the list.
 The process continues until the desired number of
cities (num_cities) is reached or until all available
cities are considered.


5. Recommending Cities within Budget:
 The code initializes an empty list
recommended_cities to store the final recommended
cities.
 It iterates over the selected cities and checks if the
flight price to the city is within the remaining budget.
 If the city&#39;s flight price is affordable, it adds the city to
the recommended cities list and updates the remaining
budget.
This process continues until all selected cities are
processed or the remaining budget becomes
insufficient.


6. Returning Recommended Cities:
 The function returns the list of recommended cities.


7. Calling the Function:
 The code sets the user code, budget, number of cities,
and user location.
 It calls the recommended_cities() function with the
provided inputs.
 The recommended cities are stored in the rec_cities
variable.
 Finally, it prints the recommended cities.
